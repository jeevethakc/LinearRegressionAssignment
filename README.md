# Linear Regression Assignment
A bike-sharing system provides bikes for short-term use, either for a fee or for free, where users borrow bikes from computer-controlled docks after entering payment information. The bikes can then be returned to any dock within the same network.

BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has seen a significant decline in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover once the lockdown ends, the company is developing a business plan to understand the post-pandemic demand for shared bikes and prepare to meet customer needs, aiming to outperform competitors and boost profits.
